# Phase 1: Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A fresh Astro project that recreates the Nikar Training Center site with similar navigation structure but a modernized, cleaner look. The key foundation piece is proper SK/EN bilingual support with separate URLs (/sk/... and /en/...) for SEO.

When complete, there's a working site skeleton with all 7 pages stubbed out in both languages, proper language switching via URL paths, and static HTML/CSS output ready for traditional FTP hosting.

The visual identity keeps the green/olive color theme from the current site but executes it more cleanly and professionally.

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **SK/EN language support with separate URLs** — /sk/cennik and /en/pricing style routing, SEO-friendly
- **Static output for FTP** — Build produces plain HTML/CSS that works on traditional shared hosting
- **Modern, clean execution** — Same olive/green theme but professionally polished

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Image gallery/portfolio — just placeholder boxes, real images come in Phase 2
- Final styling polish — basic structure and theme, refinement in Phase 4
- Google Sheets integration — static placeholder pricing tables for now

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Keep the existing 7-page navigation structure (Home, Room Overview, Equipment, Services, Pricing, Gallery, Contact)
- Olive green color scheme similar to current site (#8B8B00-ish tones)
- Language toggle should be visible in navigation like current site's flag approach, but links to /sk/ or /en/ URLs

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is a rebuild of an existing site (nikartrainingcenter.sk). The client is non-technical and will update pricing via Google Sheets. The current site works but looks dated — the rebuild should feel professional and trustworthy while maintaining familiar structure for existing visitors.

Site structure from current site:
1. Úvodná stránka (Home)
2. Prehľad miestností (Room Overview)
3. Zariadenie miestností (Room Equipment)
4. Podporné služby (Support Services)
5. Cenník (Pricing)
6. Fotogaléria (Photo Gallery)
7. Kontakt (Contact)
