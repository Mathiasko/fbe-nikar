# Phase 6: Extend Room Overview - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The room overview page should give visitors a complete picture of all available training rooms. At the top, a comparison table (like the old NIKAR site) lets visitors quickly see which room has what features - checkmarks showing equipment availability across all 4 rooms.

Below the table, each room gets its own detailed section with all its specifics - a "both combined" approach that serves both quick scanners and thorough researchers.

Single page design - all room information on `/prehlad-miestnosti` (SK) and `/room-overview` (EN), no separate pages per room.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Feature comparison table** - Clear checkmark matrix showing what each room has (like the old site)
- **All feature categories equally important** - Size, capacity, equipment, special features all clearly presented
- **4 real rooms** - Brown 101, Green 102, Yellow 201, Modrá 202 with accurate data
- **Bilingual** - Both SK and EN versions with proper translations

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Booking/reservation functionality - just information display
- No interactive elements requiring JavaScript
- This is content work, not new features

## Additional Context

Room names use colors - may want to style headers with corresponding colors (brown, green, yellow, blue) like the old site did.

Room numbers indicate floor: 101/102 = 1st floor, 201/202 = 2nd floor.
